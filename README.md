# Programacao-Funcional-Haskell

This repository contains 50 problems to be solved using the Functional Programming Paradigm.
Inside, you'll find a PDF document with the problems and an haskell file with the solution to each problem.
The comments on the Haskell file will be in English but the PDF document is written in Portuguese. The comments will be enough to understand the problem at hand though.
